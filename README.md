- Goal of the application: allow users to track their activities or tasks, each user can log in using Github OAuth.
- OAuth always not work for me 
- I chose to implement GitHub OAuth as the authentication strategy using Passport.js.


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Achieving 100% on Lighthouse Tests
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Whatâ€™s Better about DigitalOcean Compared to Glitch:
  Full control: With DigitalOcean, you have full root access to your server, meaning you can install anything and customize the environment to your needs.
  Scalability and flexibility: You can upgrade your Droplet easily, install multiple applications, or host multiple websites on the same server.
  No app sleeping: Your app will not go to sleep, unlike the free plans on Heroku and Glitch.
  Downsides of DigitalOcean Compared to Glitch:
  Requires server management: You are responsible for maintaining and securing the server. This includes tasks like updating the OS, configuring firewalls, and installing software.
- **Tech Achievement 4**: I used several Express.js middleware packages to enhance the functionality of the project:
1.passport.js: For OAuth authentication with GitHub.
2.express-session: For managing user sessions.
3.mongoose: To handle MongoDB connections and perform database operations.
4.connect-flash: To display flash messages to the user after login or logout.
5.body-parser: To parse incoming request bodies in JSON format.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative.
